## Summary

Tutorial on key features of Google Earth Studio.

## Goals

  - Gain familiarity with making 3D, geospatial movies.
  - Consider how you can use this tool in communicating your own
    research.

## Components

#### Making a simple movie

  - Using Chrome browser (required), sign in to [Google Earth
    Studio](https://www.google.com/earth/studio/)

  - Click “Try Earth Studio”

  - Click drop-down arrow next to “Blank Project”

  - Choose “Quick Starts”

  - Hover over the options for previews and choose one you’d like to
    make

  - Click on the one you want, then click “Start”

  - Follow the prompts; here’s an example of steps if you’re doing a
    Point-toPoint movie:
    
      - Type in your first location in the search box
      - Click the right hand arrow to choose your next location and so
        on
      - When finished, click “Render” & then save

  - Once your .jpegs have been rendered by Earth Studio, you need to
    stitch them into a movie:
    
      - On a Mac:
          - open Quicktime
          - File -\> Open Image Sequence -\> select all images -\>
            Choose (go)
          - exports as .mov
      - On a PC:
          - highlight all .jpgs
          - right click -\> Create New Video
          - new window opens in Photos
          - select your .jpgs (again)
          - choose the duration for each photo (0.01 sec works well)
          - exports as .mp4

#### Making a fancier movie

  - Repeat the steps above again, but try modifying the settings to
    customize it a bit more
